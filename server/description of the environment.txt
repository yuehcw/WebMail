Description of how I test my code to make sure it would work for the majority of the users using my web page: I use Web Developer tool to switch the website to mobile view, and check if the layout and everything run successfully in the mobile users point of view.



What I do to test my codes:

Test everyendpoint in 'main.ts' by making requests to the server and verifying the response. I done the testing process by using "crul".



How REST helps my web application.

1. Statelessness:

		Each HTTP request from the client to the server contains all the information needed to understand the request.
2. Scalability:
		Because REST encourages statelessness, it is easier to scale out the application by adding more backend servers as needed.

3. Uniform Interface:
		REST uses the standard HTTP methods, which provides a uniform way to interact with the webmail resources.
